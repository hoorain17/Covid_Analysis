# COVID-19 Data Analysis using R and Python

## Overview

This repository contains a thorough **COVID-19 Data Analysis** using the publicly available **OWID (Our World in Data)** dataset. The project uses a combination of **R** and **Python** for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, time-series analysis, and predictive modeling. The insights gathered aim to help understand global and country-specific trends, vaccination impacts, the relationship between testing rates and new cases, and more.

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the **OWID COVID-19 dataset** to extract insights and correlations related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and other key metrics globally. It includes the use of advanced techniques to explore trends, make predictions, and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions. The project covers 90+ key insights based on global, regional, and country-level data.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from **Our World in Data (OWID)**. The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccination rates, healthcare infrastructure, testing rates, and more.

- **Source**: [OWID COVID-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
- **Format**: CSV, containing columns such as `date`, `location`, `new_cases`, `total_cases`, `new_deaths`, `total_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, `new_tests`, and more.
- **Data Frequency**: Daily updates.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Worldwide, including country-specific data.

## Key Insights

The analysis includes the following key insights from the **OWID COVID-19 dataset**:

1. **Global Metrics**: Total cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations globally.
2. **Country Rankings**: Countries with the highest and lowest total cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage.
3. **Global Case Fatality Rate**: Calculation of global case fatality rate (CFR).
4. **Trends**: Trends of new cases, deaths, and vaccinations (daily and smoothed).
5. **Peaks Analysis**: Identification of peaks in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
6. **Reproduction Rate (R)**: Study of the reproduction rate to track the pandemic progression.
7. **Time-series Forecasting**: ICU admissions, hospitalizations, and their weekly trends.
8. **Testing vs Cases**: Relationship between testing rates and new cases.
9. **Continent-Level Analysis**: Comparison of total cases, deaths, and vaccinations across continents.
10. **Impact of Healthcare Infrastructure**: Correlation between hospital beds, ICU admissions, and fatalities.
11. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Analyzing the effects of GDP, life expectancy, and poverty on COVID-19 outcomes.
12. **Vaccination Effectiveness**: Insights on the correlation between vaccination rates and new cases or deaths.
13. **Stringency Index**: Study the effect of stringency measures (lockdowns, restrictions) on case trends.
14. **Impact of Population Density**: Analysis of how population density influenced COVID-19 spread.
15. **Excess Mortality**: Calculating excess mortality trends by country and continent.

### Additional Insights Include:
- Comparison of case and death rates by age groups, smoking prevalence, and more.
- Study of COVID-19 spread by continent and country using advanced data visualization techniques.
- Examination of the relationship between healthcare access, economic indicators, and pandemic outcomes.
